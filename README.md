# GPT-3.5-Museum-FAQ-Chatbot
[NLP, Prompt Engineering] A chatbot built with Langchain, OpenAI GPT-3.5 and a Streamlit UI that can answer questions based on the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam's FAQ list.

This project is a follow-up to my previous [Museum FAQ Chatbot](https://github.com/umbertoselva/Museum-FAQ-Chatbot) built with Sentence Transformers and ElasticSearch.
